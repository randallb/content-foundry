# Facebook's lack of storytelling cost billions and killed the brand

Companies that don't tell their own story are repeating Facebook's billion dollar mistake.

[I joined Facebook officially in 2018](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/facebook-vidpresso/), but started working with the company as a partner in 2014. Early on, our company Vidpresso rode Facebook's success into our own company's success, and we had a front row seat watching Facebook go from [beloved tech titan](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Facebook_Effect/PxTvbM-VCPEC) to [punching bag](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/29/1/zmad039/7394122).

Why did Facebook's reputation swing so wildly?

Early on, the company thrived by focusing on technical quality and relied on its users to spread the narrative. Eventually, external forces and political actors usurped the narrative to tell their own stories about Facebook, benefitting them at Facebook's expense.

Today's founders should take note.

1. If your story is being told in a way that connects with your customers, growth will happen organically.
1. Marketing optimization gets simpler if your core story is intact and spreading.
1. If you don't tell your story, it isn't your story; others will own it and use it to reap the benefits.

## Facebook focused on tech, and that was the right call

[MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) and [Friendster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster) both predated Facebook in ubiquity and popularity. But MySpace's product was not designed (they depended on you to design it), and Friendster couldn't stay up because of engineering challenges with scale.

Engineer Mark Zuckerberg found it fun to keep the servers up. After [Facebook's 2004 launch at Harvard](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/), where 1,000+ students signed up in the first week, Facebook would roll out at its own pace, as fast as they could rack up servers.

Because they spread campus to campus, they also spread student to student. The first universities to get access were Columbia, Stanford, and Yale... and instead of having a splashy on-campus launch party to get attention, the company simply allowed users with columbia.edu emails to sign up.

After the first student signed up, probably from a friend at Harvard, students would tell other students, till eventually the network saturated a campus.

While students were clamoring to get onto the platform, Zuck had to keep writing code and hiring engineers. Zuck and Facebook didn't need to tell any stories, so they didn't. Technological scaling was ultimately more important, and contributed more to their success than any marketing could have.

One of the company's first employees, current CPO [Chris Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cox_(technologist)), is actually an incredible storyteller. For years, he was the first Facebook executive every employee would meet, hosting the Monday onboarding session for new employees. He explained the ideas behind the social graph, emphasized the idea that "This is now your company," meaning as an employee you can now shepherd the company in whatever direction you want, and explained that social media's role in society is not neutral... the employees would shape how social media affects society for good or for ill.

As the company scaled employees, it told its story internally very effectively, but that internal storytelling didn't translate to external storytelling.

When the company opened the product to everyone, journalists and pop culture started to spread the gospel of Zuck. [The New Yorker published an in-depth profile of Zuck](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-face-of-facebook), the movie [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/) hit theaters, and mentions in [The Office](https://youtu.be/3Q9rewnLFYw), among others, meant Facebook was flying high. The company hit 500 million users in 2010.

## Pop Culture and Politics Shift the Story

Two months after the release of the film, a Tunisian street vendor named [Mohamed Bouazizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi) created a private Facebook group with 300,000 members discussing police corruption. Subsequently, [Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mohamed-Bouazizi).

A few weeks later, a musician named [Hamada Ben Amor (aka El General)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_General) released a rap song called "Rais Lebled" exclusively on Facebook. The song became an anthem for the impending [Jasmine Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Revolution), much of which played out on the platform.

These events signaled a dramatic shift in the company's perception in the world. No longer the plucky technological upstart, Facebook had become political. Throughout North Africa and the Middle East, protest movements spread in the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring).

Now, journalists and academics switched the story from connecting students and families to connecting political actors.

Eventually, that became the exclusive story about the company. Politicians seized on the platform, and with journalists' help, the terms "misinformation" and "fake news" drove the narrative of the 2016 election. Eventually, Zuck and other social media CEOs testified in front of the US Congress about misinformation, and Facebook suffered a spate of "move fast and break things" issues related to privacy.

## Facebook, Inc. is Replaced by Meta

Public perception of Facebook dipped, and it affected the company's ability to launch new products. Each new launch spurred articles criticizing Facebook's privacy policies, and attempts to tie brands like Instagram and Oculus closer to Facebook increasingly challenged Facebook's ability to shape its own public perception.

Eventually, Facebook had to rebrand as [Meta](https://about.meta.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) to unify its portfolio of products. If Facebook had told its own authentic story more frequently and publicly, it might have been able to retain some of its early goodwill instead of losing control of the Facebook story.

## Silicon Valley's Takeaway: Focus on Growth, Not Story?

Facebook's hesitance to tell its own story led to the brand taking a backseat. Through a huge amount of time, effort, cost, and leadership from Zuck, things seem to have worked out for Meta.

However, following Facebook's strategy is not the right playbook for most startups today.

Startups are not at the mercy of technological challenges threatening their company's existence. Plenty of other issues can fill that vacuum for founders, but without carving space to tell their story, any subsequent marketing, fundraising, or recruiting efforts will be much more challenging than needed.

At Facebook, marketing meant growth. Having users friend other users was the core feature of the product, so growth teams were marketing optimization teams. These teams weren't focused on storytelling (story-led growth) but instead on optimizing products and sign-up pages for moving users through the funnel efficiently (marketing optimization).

That worked because students and eventually journalists spread the word on their own, and the product's retention was insanely high. Fixing the bottom-of-funnel was the problem for Facebook since their top-of-funnel was already full.

Engineer-founded startups take this lesson without applying the full funnel. It's simple to focus on marketing optimization because it's a math problem. If you have content, show it to users, you can measure the click-through rate all the way to retention rate. Paying money to put that content in front of users means your top of funnel is solved, but each incremental user joining the funnel costs money.

Content must do more than boost your bottom-of-funnel metrics.

## What Should Startups Do Today?

The lesson is clear: To grow widely, someone needs to tell your story. Subsequent social networks figured that out. TikTok is the place for pop culture, personal expression, and trends. Snapchat is the platform for personal connection. ~~Twitter~~ X is the place for public conversation, and Bluesky is telling its story as the non-Elon, open protocol alternative to Twitter.

Growth marketing optimizations are still important, but they'll cost more and be less effective.

Startups that ignore story-led growth do so at their own peril. Founders already have to tell their story to attract employees, customers, investors and countless other stakeholders. Today, finding ways to tell your story at scale is no longer optional. We'll explain some ways through our blog over the next few posts… and we'll start to tell our own story. Stay tuned.
