# Story-led growth: Focus on customers, not marketing

> I grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in the cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking, table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and isn't too fussy about how. As I've written before, one of the things that has surprised me most about startups is how few of the most successful founders are like that. Maybe successful people in other industries are; I don't know; but not startup founders.

For me, Donald Trump is the ultimate cartoonish businessman. Real estate, Trump's alleged forte, is fundamentally about reallocating value and not creating value. It's designed to [extract the maximum return on its net assets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_net_assets). Newer companies like Google, Apple and Facebook focus mostly on solving problems for people by building products.

People can choose who they work with, what products they buy, and who they listen to more than ever before. Personally, I'd rather work with companies that focus on [building wonderful products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Something_Wonderful), not maximizing profits. Both kinds of companies typically start with founder solving a problem they saw / experienced, and building a business to support fixing this for other people.

Storytelling is the difference between them. An honest story told authentically will attract the right employees, partners, and customers, en masse.

If you were a manager at McDonald's, you could tell employees: “This is the time I pay you to be here.”  Or, you can tell them: “Even though it might not seem like it, McDonald's is a break for a lot of people. Kids love coming to McDonald's. Parents love it, too… they get to skip cooking a meal, give their kids some food and a smile, and the kids leave with a toy. Serving quality meals quickly makes families happy. It's important. That's what the Happy Meal is.”

Both stories are true, the worker has exactly the same job, but one story will connect them with their customers, and the other connects them with clocking out.

Stories do a lot. They help people [memorize decks of playing cards](https://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/how-to-memorize-a-deck-of-cards/), find their keys, lose weight, avoid injury and death, create movements, understand how to love, or thrive in their environment. Stories take connected facts and compress them in a way that helps people learn without firsthand experience.

Our evolution depended on storytelling. Stories help [multiple regions of the brain encode  information together](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0112575), and it turns out large language AI models [might use similar mechanisms to predict the next words in a sentence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02662).

When companies tell stories, they typically do it through what they call “marketing activities.” Companies want people to purchase their products instead of others when compared to others. [Gabriel Weinberg's Traction](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/A3_MBgAAQBAJ?hl=en) is a great introduction to the topic.

The best products aren't actually being compared in a marketplace anymore. Instead of competing for room on store shelves with brightly colored oversized boxes, friends tell other friends about the products they find wonderful. 

Eventually marketing becomes impossible, and the largest companies instead focus on storytelling. They call that brand marketing, but they're actually just trying to connect their company with the story that resonates with their customers.

Many early-stage companies acquire the majority of their customers through well-targeted Instagram ads, but behemoths like Google and Meta spent $0 to acquire customers in their early days. Their products were good enough that customers developed their own stories about how Google Search or Facebook made their lives better. That was enough for people to tell other people. Ironically, these same big companies now spend a lot of money to make sure you know their story.

# What's your story?

As a journalist and general weirdo, one of the first questions I ask people is not, “where are you from?” or “what do you do?” but instead “What's your story?” It's a disarming way to get people to tell you what they wanted to tell you anyway. If you're in New York, they'll probably tell you their job and where they went to school. If you're in Utah, they'll probably tell you about how they are or are not Mormon, their relationship to the area, and likely the city they grew up in.

After I understand their story, I start to probe into more interesting parts until I feel like I've learned something more fundamental about them. Obviously this isn't a one-sided interaction, I actually have a pretty tight life story that I often use to explain my life from my birth through the current conversation. (Seriously, it takes 5 minutes. I'll record it.)

Being able to connect your story from where you were to where you are isn't about detailed fact finding… it's actually about compressing the most relevant information for your audience and spending exactly the right amount of time telling it. Zuck got used to others doing it for him, so he never really had to make an effort, until he did.

Sociopaths tell different stories to manipulate people against each other and get outcomes they want. Honest people focus on telling the same story to everyone, tailoring the details for relevance, not truth.

You are always telling a story, consciously or not. Thinking about the story you'd like to tell that feels authentic to you will connect you to customers, partners, and mentors that will help you. Telling an inauthentic story will connect you to other inauthentic people.

Getting better at storytelling is not getting better at lying. It's getting better at telling the truth.
