# Content Foundry: Simplified Product Overview

We’re launching **Content Foundry**, a platform designed to help users refine their online voice, find new ideas, and interact meaningfully on social media. This initial product (sometimes referred to as the “story bank”) will roll out in phases, ensuring we ship a minimal viable product quickly and then iterate to add more value over time.

## Phase One: **Input**

**Goal:** Launch anything—prove out the basic idea.

1. **Take a user’s Twitter handle**  
   - Connect via the Twitter API (OAuth).
2. **Retrieve their most recent _N_ tweets** (e.g., 200)  
   - Store tweets for analysis.
3. **Generate a “voice profile”**  
   - Summarize common phrases, tone, or style patterns from the tweets.

This phase gives us the foundation: raw data from Twitter and an initial sense of the user’s writing voice.

## Phase Two: **Voice Improvement**

**Goal:** Provide helpful recommendations that make sense in context.

- **Analyze the user’s voice profile** to find areas for improvement (e.g., clarity, tone, engaging language).  
- **Suggest edits or alternatives** to help the user refine their style.  
- **Maintain user’s unique voice** while improving coherence and appeal.

By the end of this phase, we’ll be offering actionable tips to polish a user’s tweets while preserving their personal style.

## Phase Three: **AI Feedback & Training**

**Goal:** Use human feedback to train a better recommendation system.

- **Collect user feedback** on the suggestions (likes, dislikes, skipped suggestions).  
- **Refine the AI models** based on what works for different voices.  
- **Iterate quickly** to improve suggestion accuracy and usefulness.

The system becomes smarter over time, learning from each accepted or rejected recommendation to tailor future suggestions more effectively.

## Phase Four: **Trends & Ideas**

**Goal:** Give users fresh perspectives and prompt new content ideas.

- **Identify trending topics** related to the user’s interests.  
- **Suggest new angles or topics** that the user might not have discovered otherwise.  
- **Encourage creative engagement**, helping users stand out on social platforms.

This phase goes beyond style refinement; it actively feeds users with inspiration to keep their content interesting and relevant.

## Phase Five: **Social Interaction**

**Goal:** Help users discover conversations and interact meaningfully with others.

- **Surface discussions** that align with the user’s expertise or interests.  
- **Make it easy** to jump into relevant threads or respond to others.  
- **Expand the user’s network** by connecting them with people talking about shared interests.

Example scenario:  
> Justin usually doesn’t watch football, but if he’s passionate about broadcast graphics, the system would flag related conversations on Twitter, enabling him to share his expertise and engage with others in that niche.

## Summary

1. **Phase One** sets the groundwork by collecting tweets and creating a voice profile.  
2. **Phase Two** refines the user’s style with clear, coherent suggestions.  
3. **Phase Three** uses feedback loops to make AI-driven suggestions more accurate.  
4. **Phase Four** surfaces trending ideas, broadening the user’s content scope.  
5. **Phase Five** fosters meaningful social interaction, helping users discover and join relevant conversations.

By rolling out in these stages, we can quickly ship a minimal version, learn from real-world use, and evolve our platform into a powerful tool for content creation, discovery, and community engagement.
