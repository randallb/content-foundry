# 2024 Lookback

It was a crazy year. We actually ended the year about where we landed at our peak, which was surprising.

## What we did

### Comedy actually kind of worked!
We had a bunch of comedy customers, and it was surprising that we had as many as we did.

We never actually shipped a hair on fire problem fixer, but it was awesome to see
our team come together.

#### Highs

* Gabriel Iglasias

#### Lows

* Making pointless software

### Team gellin'

We came together and had each others' backs.

#### Highs

* Randall got healthy!

#### Lows

* Losing customers, etc.

## What we learned

### **1. The Original Hypothesis Was Too Narrow**
- AI + Video didn’t solve a real problem.
- Expanding beyond comedy clubs proved difficult.
- Tooling for better/shorter videos wasn’t enough to build a sustainable business.

### **2. The Real Problem: Knowing What to Create**
- Content creation tools aren’t the bottleneck—**figuring out what content to make** is.
- Early startups (**Seed to Series B**) struggle with marketing because they haven’t developed content strategies.

### **3. Startups Need a Content Operating System**
A structured system to **define, create, distribute, and measure** content effectively.

### **The Current Content Operating System**
| Stage       | Current Challenges |
|------------|------------------|
| **Story Bank** | Scattered in Google Docs, not shared. |
| **Sourcing Content** | Executives rely on random tweets. |
| **Creation** | Disconnected tools (**CMS, Mailchimp, Buffer, Canva, TikTok, Premiere, etc.**) |
| **Distribution** | Social networks + ever expanding platforms |
| **Analytics** | Fragmented tracking (**Posthog, Sprout Social, YouTube, Twitter, etc.**) |



## We're making an AI-First, Open-Source Replacement for WordPress
- **Cloud-hosted** → Easy setup for companies & creators.
- **Open-source & On-prem** → Deploy with **two clicks in Replit** or run locally.
- **Developer-friendly** → Easiest platform to contribute to, with **potential economic upside**.

### **The Content Foundry Operating System**
| Stage       | Content Foundry's Approach |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **Story Bank** | Integrated **brand book**. |
| **Sourcing** | AI-assisted idea generation based on **industry trends**. |
| **Creation** | **Stock + Flow model** for repurposing blogs, newsletters, videos into **GIFs, TikToks, memes**. |
| **Distribution** | Send the content where it needs to end up, but also own your own platform. |
| **Analytics** | Unified tracking to **measure success and refine content strategy**. |
