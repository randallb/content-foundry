1. Build either: A figma, a spec, or a standalone app (using replit agent) that
   illustrates the feature or idea you'd like to build.
2. Build the other side of it, either a spec if you made a visual, or vice versa.
3. Break down the feature into the smallest steps possible.
4. Use replit assistant, agent, or o1-pro to execute.

After each step, try to review the progress with a human and AI to understand if
you're heading in the right direction.
